Traffic Light Control with Arduino Uno and LabVIEW
Overview
This project simulates a traffic light system using an Arduino Uno and LabVIEW. The Arduino controls three LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow) to replicate a traffic light sequence, while LabVIEW provides a graphical interface to manage the sequence and adjust timing parameters.
Features

LED Control: Arduino drives Red, Green, and Yellow LEDs for traffic light states.
LabVIEW GUI: Interface to start/stop the sequence and configure light durations.
Custom Timing: Adjust Red, Green, and Yellow state durations via LabVIEW.
Real-Time Feedback: Displays current light state on the LabVIEW front panel.
Serial Communication: Arduino and LabVIEW interact via serial protocol.

Hardware Requirements

Arduino Uno (or compatible microcontroller)
3 LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow)
3 resistors (220-330 ohms, depending on LED specifications)
Breadboard and jumper wires
USB cable (Type A to Type B)
Computer with LabVIEW and Arduino IDE installed

Software Requirements

Arduino IDE: For uploading the control sketch to the Arduino.
LabVIEW: Version 2018 or later, with NI-VISA and MakerHub LINX (or LIFA for older versions).
Drivers: Arduino USB drivers for serial communication.

Setup Instructions

Hardware Assembly:

Connect Red LED to Arduino pin 11, Green to pin 10, Yellow to pin 9 (each with a resistor in series).
Connect LED cathodes to Arduino GND.
Connect Arduino to the computer via USB.


Arduino Programming:

Open Arduino IDE and load TrafficLight.ino from the src folder.
Upload the sketch to the Arduino Uno.


LabVIEW Configuration:

Install LabVIEW, NI-VISA, and LINX (or LIFA).
Open Traffic Light with Arduino.vi from the labview folder in LabVIEW.
Select the correct COM port for the Arduino.


Running the System:

Launch Traffic Light with Arduino.vi in LabVIEW.
Use the GUI to start/stop the sequence and adjust light durations.
Verify LED behavior aligns with LabVIEW commands.



Project Structure

src/TrafficLight.ino: Arduino sketch for LED control via serial commands.
labview/Traffic Light with Arduino.vi: LabVIEW VI for GUI and serial communication.
docs/: Contains circuit diagrams and additional resources.

Usage

Open Traffic Light with Arduino.vi and select the Arduinoâ€™s COM port.
Set durations for Red, Green, and Yellow states using numeric controls.
Toggle the Start/Stop button to control the traffic light sequence.
Monitor the current state via the LabVIEW GUI and LED outputs.

Troubleshooting

Arduino Not Detected: Confirm the COM port and install Arduino drivers if needed.
LEDs Not Lighting: Check wiring, resistor values, and sketch upload.
LabVIEW Errors: Ensure NI-VISA and LINX/LIFA are properly installed.
